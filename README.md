Continuous Engagement Ltd Website

Create a website for Continuous Engagement Ltd – a consultancy that specialises in Continuous Improvement 
    through: Lean, 6 Sigma and Operational Excellence.
The branding is to match the profile photograph of the Director.
There should be an overview of: the Services provided, the Methods employed, and Contact information.
The site will be used to supplement the information that the Director will send to prospective Clients and 
    Recruiters. It is more likely the site will be “pushed” to users than the user will actively seek it out.

UX
Websites that I specifically reviewed for inspiration on: style, layout and navigation:
	www.amazon.co.uk
	www.facebook.com
	www.reinvigoration.com 
… particularly in the formatting from mobile to desktop devices, menus and text layout.

User Stories have been grouped into 2: Director of Continuous Engagement (site owner) and Clients/Recruiters (user)
As the Director of Continuous Engagement, I …

1.	… want the user to see a professional “shop-window” for my company.
2.	… want the user to have all of the regulatory information for the company (Company number, VAT number etc.)
3.	… want the user to have contact information for the company.
4.	… want the user to be aware of the different methodologies that I use.
5.	… want the user to have a brief overview of these methodologies (with links to external sources for further 
    reading).
6.	… want the user to see examples of where I have put these methodologies into practice.
7.	… want to user to see the benefits of putting these methodologies into practice.
8.	… want the user to be aware of the various industries that I have applied these methods to.
9.	… want the user to have an overview of the services that Continuous Engagement offers them (training, 
    coaching, deployment, resourcing).
10.	… want to use this site as a means to link my consultancy work with my programming work – ultimately adding 
    Agile and Web Development to the showcase.

As the Client/Recruiter, I …

1.	… want to understand what Continuous Engagement do; visually and quickly, without having to navigate 
    through lots of information.
2.	… want to be able to dive deeper into what Continuous Engagement can do for me as and when I see fit.
3.	… want to know what I will receive from Continuous Engagement if I engage with them.
4.	… want to know that Continuous Engagement has been successful elsewhere.
5.	… want to be able to contact Continuous Engagement for a follow-up conversation.
6.	… want to be able to view this information easily on all digital devices.
7.	… want to know that Continuous Engagement is a professional company.
8.	… want to be assured that Continuous Engagement can benefit my business, and want to contract with them.

I produced the following mockups prior to writing any code. I found that tremendously useful as I made a lot 
    of design and functionality decisions up front. I also researched a particular Bootstrap 
    capability – “Accordion/Collapse” (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/collapse/#accordion-example) 
    as when I was designing the methods.html layout, I felt the best method would be to hide and reveal relevant 
    content on the page (rather than navigate to separate pages)
